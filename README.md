##### Dotfiles
A place to store common dotfile config (.vimrc, .bashrc etc) 

Not the first person to come up with this idea 


vim/.vimrc = starting from scratch and working my way back
works with ln -s /home/blah/dotfiles/vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

## TODO:
- add install of terminator profiles via script
- add shellcheck install 
- checks to make sure that existing .bashrc isn't destroyed
